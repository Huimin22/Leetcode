## 1. Problem

62. Unique Paths
    
## 2. Summary

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
dp[0][j] = 1
dp[i][0] = 1
return dp[m-1][n-1]
```



## 3. Key Points

```
dp[i][j] = paths to (i,j)
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
dp[0][j] = 1, dp[i][0] = 1
result = dp[m-1][n-1]
only right or down moves
```




## 4. Code Implementation:

```
 class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[m-1][n-1]  
```

## 6. Edge Cases

## 7. Follow-ups

## 8. Note

**Mistake**

Confused 1D vs 2D DP

Didn't track dp array updates step by step

Unclear boundary conditions (first row/column)

Overlooked only right/down moves

**Second**

Index control weak.

Did not internalize: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].

Confused loop variables with target assignment.

Hard-coded final cell (m-1, n-1) instead of using (i, j).

Can initialize DP table with 1 directly instead of manually setting first row and first column.
