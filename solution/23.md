## 1. Problem
23. Merge k Sorted Lists
    
## 2. Summary

 **Divide & conquer = shrink the range, hit the base case, merge on the way back up.**

 LC21 merge two sorted lists. Imagine we only need to merge two sorted lists. 
 
 Have another helper function to have one half and the other half already sorted.

## 3. Key Points

* **Overall idea**:
  Use divide & conquer to merge *k* sorted linked lists by repeatedly merging two lists at a time.

* **`merge(l1, l2)`**:
  A helper function (LC21) that merges **two sorted linked lists**.
  Treat it as a black-box tool.

* **`divide(lists, left, right)`**:
  Recursively merges all lists in the index range **`[left, right]`** into one sorted list.

* **Base case**:
  `left == right` → only one list, return it directly.

* **Recursive formula**:

  ```
  divide(left, right) =
      merge(
          divide(left, mid),
          divide(mid + 1, right)
      )
  ```

* **Critical pitfall** ⚠️:
  The interval **must strictly shrink**.
  The right half must start at `mid + 1`, not `mid`, or you get infinite recursion.


## 4. Code Implementation:

```
   # Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not lists:
            return None

        def merge(l1, l2):  # LC21
            dummy = ListNode(0)
            cur = dummy
            while l1 and l2:
                if l1.val < l2.val:
                    cur.next = l1
                    l1 = l1.next
                else:
                    cur.next = l2
                    l2 = l2.next
                cur = cur.next
            cur.next = l1 or l2
            return dummy.next

        def divide(lists, left, right):
            if left == right:
                return lists[left]
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            list1 = divide(lists, left, mid)
            list2 = divide(lists, mid + 1, right)
            return merge(list1, list2)
```

## 5. Complexity Analysis

  * Each level processes all nodes → O(N)
  * There are log k levels → **O(N log k)**
        
## 6. Edge Cases

## 7. Follow-ups

## 8. Note

**Second**

Not very familiar with *Divide & conquer func. 

mergedTwo Function, have an issue: cur = dummy.next

Don't get the pointer cur, this means the start position, dummy.next is None. 

.next concept is not clearly understood.
