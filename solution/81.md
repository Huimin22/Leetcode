The reason we can shrink the search range is that the values at the three positions are the same, and we have already confirmed that `mid` is not equal to the target. Since all three positions contain the same value, the boundary elements cannot be the target either. Therefore, it is safe to shrink the range.

If we do not handle this case and shrink the range, we will not be able to perform the later monotonic (sorted) interval check.

For example:

```
nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
target = 2
```

In this case, we cannot determine which side is sorted, so shrinking the range is necessary.
