## 1. Problem
5. Longest Palindromic Substring
    
## 2. Summary

Palindrome = symmetric around a center.

Two centers: single char (odd) or gap (even).

Expand left/right from each center, track the longest.


## 3. Key Points

A palindrome is symmetric, so it can be found by expanding from a center.

**Two types of centers:**

Odd-length → single character

Even-length → gap between two characters


Expand left and right from each center while characters match.

Track longest palindrome with start and end indexes.  

Check all indices as potential centers to cover all palindromes.
