Why BFS is used for shortest path (Follow-up Summary)

**Core Reason**

BFS explores nodes **level by level**.

In an unweighted graph:

* Level = number of edges from the start node
* First time reaching a node = shortest path to that node

So when the target is first found, that path is guaranteed to be the shortest.

---

### Mental Model

> BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs because it explores by distance (level order).

* **BFS = shortest path (unweighted graph)**
  → Expands in waves
  → Guarantees minimum steps

* **DFS = full path exploration**
  → Goes deep first
  → Does NOT guarantee shortest path
