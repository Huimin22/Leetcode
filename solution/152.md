Including nums[i] is necessary — we are deciding: extend the previous product or start new?  



The idea:

At each index i, we want to track the range of possibilities for a subarray ending at i:

cur_max → the maximum product of any subarray ending at i

cur_min → the minimum product of any subarray ending at i

Why track both?

Because multiplying a negative number flips max ↔ min.

A very small negative product could become the largest if the next number is negative.
