## 1. Problem

    
## 2. Idea



## 3. Key Points

area = (j−i)×min(height[i],height[j])

Use two pointers from both ends, always move the shorter line, since area = width × shorter height, to efficiently find the maximum water.

## 4. Code Implementation:


```
code
   


```

## 5. Complexity Analysis
    Time：O(n)
        
    Space: O(1)
        
## 6. Edge Cases

## 7. Follow-ups

## 8. Note
