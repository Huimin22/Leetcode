## 1. Problem
206. Reverse Linked List
    
## 2. Summary

1️⃣ Save the original next pointer

2️⃣ Modify curr.next to reverse the link

3️⃣ Move curr forward using the saved pointer


## 3. Key Points

1️⃣ Core Idea

Reverse the direction of each node’s next pointer while traversing the list once.

2️⃣ Use Three Pointers

prev → already reversed part

curr → current node being processed

next → saved reference to avoid losing the rest of the list

3️⃣ Critical Order of Operations

Save next
Reverse pointer
Move forward


The order is everything.
If you reverse before saving next, you lose the rest of the list.

## 4. Code Implementation:
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt

        return prev   
```

## 8. Note

🔁 Reverse Linked List – Core Idea

The essence of this problem is:

For each node, reverse the direction of its pointer so that it points to the previous node instead of the next one.

🔄 Arrow Direction Change

Original:

1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → None


After reversing:

1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4

🧠 Pointer Roles

curr → used to traverse the current node

prev → keeps track of the previous node (the already reversed part)

next (or nxt) → temporarily stores the next node to prevent losing the rest of the list

**Second**

Mistake:

Don't understand the meaning and function of nxt pointer.

After change cur.next, it was changed, can't use this way to move forward cur.

That's why we save the cur.next as nxt pointer for future.

❌ cur = cur.next

**Third**

Pass

Be cautious to use the same pointer.
After change cur.next, it was changed, can't use this way to move forward cur.
❌ cur = cur.next
